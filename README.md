*(Placeholder Image - A proper screenshot showcasing the retro UI will be added)*

**RetroIDE** is an AI-powered Integrated Development Environment with a nostalgic twist! It combines the power of modern AI code assistance, collaboration, and DevOps tooling with a pixel-art user interface reminiscent of Windows 3.1 and Mac System 7.

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Firebase, RetroIDE aims to provide a unique and productive development experience.

## Core Features ‚ú®

1.  **Pixel-Art UI Shell:**
    *   Classic Windows 3.1 / Mac System 7 aesthetic using custom styling and potentially libraries like `98.css` principles.
    *   Layout: File Explorer (left), Code Editor (center), Terminal/Logs (bottom), AI Chat & Collaboration (right), Floating Plugin Manager.
    *   Beveled menus (File, Edit, View, Plugins, AI, Tools, Help).

2.  **Modular Plugin System:**
    *   Extend IDE functionality with custom tools (linters, formatters, generators) via a defined JSON schema API.
    *   In-IDE Marketplace for discovering, installing, and updating plugins.
    *   Support for user-defined YAML workflows (build, test, deploy) triggered by events.

3.  **Collaboration & DevOps:**
    *   *(Planned)* Real-time collaborative editing.
    *   *(Planned)* Integrated voice/video communication.
    *   *(Planned)* AI-coordinated suggestions during collaboration.
    *   Automated Terraform module generation and application for Firebase resources.
    *   One-click Docker/Kubernetes development environment setup with live reloading.

4.  **Observability & Security:**
    *   AI-powered Profiling Panel for analyzing frontend bundles and backend traces.
    *   Built-in SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and dependency scanning.
    *   *(Planned)* Automated Pull Request generation for security fixes.
    *   Telemetry Dashboard displaying errors, performance metrics, and AI usage.

5.  **AI Engine & Memory:**
    *   Multi-model support: Gemini, Claude, GPT-4o, and Llama (via Ollama integration).
    *   *(Planned)* Fine-tuning capabilities on the project's repository.
    *   *(Planned)* Long-term memory using vector embeddings (Firestore/Redis) for architecture and coding standards.
    *   Short-term session context tracking for coherent AI conversations.
    *   *(Planned)* Voice and gesture command integration for AI actions (e.g., "Explain this function", "Generate unit tests").

## Style Guide üé®

*   **Color Palette:** Muted, desaturated colors common in early 90s UIs.
    *   Primary Accent: Teal (`#008080`).
    *   Background: Light Gray (`hsl(210 0% 92%)`).
    *   Borders: Light (`hsl(0 0% 100%)`) and Dark (`hsl(0 0% 40%)`) for 3D bevel effects.
*   **Fonts:** `Pixelify Sans` (or similar pixelated font) for UI elements. Monospaced font for the code editor.
*   **Icons:** Simple, blocky, pixel-art style icons (using `lucide-react` where appropriate, potentially custom SVGs).
*   **Windows & Dialogs:** Fixed-size (initially), draggable windows with classic title bars and controls. Sharp corners (`radius: 0rem`).
*   **Animations:** Basic, subtle animations for window interactions (mimicking limitations of older systems).

## Deliverables üì¶

*   **Scaffolded Project:** Next.js 15+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui pre-configured.
*   **Firebase Integration:** `.firebaserc`, `firebase.json` configured for Firebase Studio preview.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Basic Terraform configurations for relevant Firebase services.
*   **CI/CD:** Placeholder GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
*   **Plugin System:**
    *   *(Planned)* Plugin API documentation (JSON schema).
    *   *(Planned)* Sample plugins demonstrating API usage.
    *   *(Planned)* Example YAML workflow files.
*   **AI Integration:**
    *   Genkit setup for multi-model AI interaction.
    *   *(Planned)* Prompt templates for code generation, testing, documentation, and security scanning.
*   **Documentation:** This README, including:
    *   Setup and usage instructions.
    *   Retro style guide overview.
    *   *(Planned)* Voice/gesture command mappings.
    *   *(Planned)* Extension marketplace guide.
