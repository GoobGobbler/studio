# **App Name**: RetroIDE

## Core Features:

- Retro UI Shell: Implements a retro-style UI shell reminiscent of Windows 3.1/Mac System 7, using pixel-art aesthetics (98.css/retro-react).
- AI Code Assistant: Integrates a multi-model AI engine (Gemini, Claude, GPT-4o, Llama via Ollama) for code suggestions and explanations. The AI tool tracks session context for coherent responses.
- Plugin System: Sets up a modular plugin system allowing users to extend the IDE with custom tools (linters, formatters, generators) and YAML workflows (build/test/deploy).

## Style Guidelines:

- Use muted, desaturated colors typical of early 90s interfaces.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for highlights and active elements.
- Pixelated fonts to mimic the look of old computer displays.
- Simple, blocky icons reminiscent of Windows 3.1 and Mac System 7.
- Fixed-size windows and dialog boxes, arranged in a tiled or overlapping manner.
- Basic, pixelated animations for window resizing and transitions.
